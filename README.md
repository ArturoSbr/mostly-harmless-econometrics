# Mostly Harmless Econometrics

This repo provides a brief summary of every chapter in Mostly Harmless
Econometrics.

## Structure

Like the book, this repo book is divided in three main sections:

```
.
├ README.md
├ 1-preliminaries
│ ├ 11-questions-about-questions.tex
│ └ 12-experimental-ideal.tex
├ 2-core
│ └ 21-making-regression-make-sense.tex
└ 3-extensions
```

## Misc
I try to update this repo as often as I can. That said, this is a side project
so expect tons of regular breaks.
